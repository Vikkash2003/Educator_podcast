In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians,\nslaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all\nof these classes, again, subordinate gradations.\nThe modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with\nclass antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in\nplace of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it\nhas simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile\ncamps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nFrom the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these\nburgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.\nThe discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie.\nThe East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the\nmeans of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse\nnever before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid\ndevelopment.\nThe feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now\nno longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The\nguild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the\ndifferent corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.\nMeantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacture no longer sufficed.\nThereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken\nby the giant, Modern Industry, the place of the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders\nof whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.\nModern industry has established the world-market, for which the discovery of America paved the way.\nThis market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This\ndevelopment has, in its time, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce,\nnavigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and\npushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.\nWe see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a\nseries of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.\nEach step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of\nthat class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association\nin the mediaeval commune; here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany), there taxable “third\nestate” of the monarchy (as in France), afterwards, in the period of manufacture proper, serving either the\nsemi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the\ngreat monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of\nthe world-market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The\nexecutive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\nThe bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 3/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic\nrelations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors,” and\nhas left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash\npayment.” It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of\nphilistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into\nexchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single,\nunconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political\nillusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\nThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent\nawe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage\nlabourers.\nThe bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a\nmere money relation.\nThe bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages,\nwhich Reactionists so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been\nthe first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian\npyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all\nformer Exoduses of nations and crusades.\nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby\nthe relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of\nproduction in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial\nclasses. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting\nuncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen\nrelations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed\nones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and\nman is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\nThe need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface\nof the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.\nThe bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character to\nproduction and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under\nthe feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been\ndestroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a\nlife and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material,\nbut raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home,\nbut in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we\nfind new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old\nlocal and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of\nindividual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more\nand more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated\nmeans of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of its\ncommodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the\nbarbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction,\nto adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their\nmidst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.\nThe bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has\ngreatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of\nthe population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has\nmade barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations\nof bourgeois, the East on the West.\nThe bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means\nof production, and of property. It has agglomerated production, and has concentrated property in a few hands.\nThe necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected\nprovinces, with separate interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into\none nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier and one customshttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 4/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\ntariff. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more\ncolossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man,\nmachinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric\ntelegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out\nof the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap\nof social labour?\nWe see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up,\nwere generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of\nexchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of\nagriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer\ncompatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst\nasunder; they were burst asunder.\nInto their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it,\nand by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class.\nA similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society with its relations of\nproduction, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production\nand of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom\nhe has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history\nof the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property\nrelations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule. It is enough to mention the\ncommercial crises that by their periodical return put on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence\nof the entire bourgeois society. In these crises a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the\npreviously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises there breaks out an epidemic\nthat, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity—the epidemic of over-production. Society\nsuddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war\nof devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be\ndestroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much\nindustry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the\ndevelopment of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for\nthese conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder\ninto the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of\nbourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get\nover these crises? On the one hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the\nconquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the\nway for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are\nprevented.\nThe weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the\nbourgeoisie itself.\nBut not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into\nexistence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians.\nIn proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the\nmodern working class, developed—a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who\nfind work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the\nvicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\nOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all\nindividual character, and consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the\nmachine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of\nhim. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence\nthat he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and\ntherefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the\nwork increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour\nincreases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working\nhours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.\nModern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the\nindustrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 5/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nthe industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not\nonly are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by\nthe machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more\nopenly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more\nembittering it is.\nThe less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern\nindustry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age\nand sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour,\nmore or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he receives his\nwages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the\npawnbroker, etc.\nThe lower strata of the middle class—the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the\nhandicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive\ncapital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the\ncompetition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new\nmethods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.\nThe proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the\nbourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory,\nthen by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits\nthem. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments\nof production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces\nmachinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the\nMiddle Ages.\nAt this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up\nby their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the\nconsequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its\nown political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to\ndo so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies,\nthe remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus\nthe whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a\nvictory for the bourgeoisie.\nBut with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated\nin greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of\nlife within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all\ndistinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition\namong the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more\nfluctuating. The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood\nmore and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more\nand more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations\n(Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found\npermanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there the\ncontest breaks out into riots.\nNow and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the\nimmediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved\nmeans of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities\nin contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local\nstruggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a\npolitical struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable\nhighways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.\nThis organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political party, is continually\nbeing upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger,\nfirmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage\nof the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus the ten-hours’ bill in England was carried.\nAltogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of\ndevelopment of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 6/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\naristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic\nto the progress of industry; at all times, with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees\nitself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The\nbourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own instruments of political and general\neducation, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.\nFurther, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry,\nprecipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply\nthe proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.\nFinally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within\nthe ruling class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a\nsmall section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the\nfuture in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the\nbourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the\nbourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical\nmovement as a whole.\nOf all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really\nrevolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the\nproletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the\nshopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their\nexistence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more,\nthey are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they\nare so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their present, but\ntheir future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\nThe “dangerous class,” the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old\nsociety, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life,\nhowever, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.\nIn the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The\nproletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with\nthe bourgeois family-relations; modern industrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England\nas in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality,\nreligion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois\ninterests.\nAll the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify their already acquired status by\nsubjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the\nproductive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also\nevery other previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their\nmission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.\nAll previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interests of minorities. The\nproletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interests\nof the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise\nitself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.\nThough not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a\nnational struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own\nbourgeoisie.\nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less\nveiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open\nrevolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the\nproletariat.\nHitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing\nand oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it\ncan, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership\nin the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a\nbourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper\nand deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops\nmore rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any\nlonger to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an overhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 7/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nriding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery,\nbecause it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.\nSociety can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with\nsociety.\nThe essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and\naugmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively on\ncompetition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie,\nreplaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to\nassociation. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on\nwhich the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above\nall, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 8/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nII.\nPROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS\nIn what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?\nThe Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties.\nThey have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.\nThey do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian\nmovement.\nThe Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: (1) In the national\nstruggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common\ninterests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. (2) In the various stages of development\nwhich the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and\neverywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\nThe Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the\nworking-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand,\ntheoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line\nof march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.\nThe immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of\nthe proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the\nproletariat.\nThe theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been\ninvented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms,\nactual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our\nvery eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism.\nAll property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the\nchange in historical conditions.\nThe French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.\nThe distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of\nbourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the\nsystem of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the\nmany by the few.\nIn this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private\nproperty.\nWe Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring\nproperty as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal\nfreedom, activity and independence.\nHard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the\nsmall peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the\ndevelopment of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\nOr do you mean modern bourgeois private property?\nBut does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of\nproperty which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new\nsupply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of\ncapital and wage-labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.\nTo be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a\ncollective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united\naction of all members of society, can it be set in motion.\nCapital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 9/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nWhen, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society,\npersonal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the\nproperty that is changed. It loses its class-character.\nLet us now take wage-labour.\nThe average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence,\nwhich is absolutely requisite in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates\nby means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to\nabolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the\nmaintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of\nothers. All that we want to do away with, is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the\nlabourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class\nrequires it.\nIn bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist society,\naccumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\nIn bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present\ndominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person\nis dependent and has no individuality.\nAnd the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom!\nAnd rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is\nundoubtedly aimed at.\nBy freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and\nbuying.\nBut if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling\nand buying, and all the other “brave words” of our bourgeoisie about freedom in general, have a meaning, if\nany, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have\nno meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of\nproduction, and of the bourgeoisie itself.\nYou are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private\nproperty is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to\nits non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away\nwith a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for\nthe immense majority of society.\nIn one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what\nwe intend.\nFrom the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power\ncapable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed\ninto bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say individuality vanishes.\nYou must, therefore, confess that by “individual” you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the\nmiddle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.\nCommunism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to\ndeprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriation.\nIt has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease, and universal laziness\nwill overtake us.\nAccording to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for\nthose of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not work. The whole of\nthis objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when\nthere is no longer any capital.\nAll objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products,\nhave, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and appropriating\nintellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of\nproduction itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all\nculture.\nThat culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a\nmachine.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 10/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nBut don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the\nstandard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, etc. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the\nconditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of\nyour class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential character and direction are determined by the\neconomical conditions of existence of your class.\nThe selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the\nsocial forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property—historical relations that\nrise and disappear in the progress of production—this misconception you share with every ruling class that\nhas preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal\nproperty, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.\nAbolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\nOn what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its\ncompletely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its\ncomplement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\nThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish\nwith the vanishing of capital.\nDo you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead\nguilty.\nBut, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.\nAnd your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you\neducate, by the intervention, direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.? The Communists have\nnot invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that\nintervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.\nThe bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parent and child,\nbecomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all family ties among the\nproletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and\ninstruments of labour.\nBut you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of\nproduction are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of\nbeing common to all will likewise fall to the women.\nHe has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments\nof production.\nFor the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of\nwomen which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists\nhave no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\nOur bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not\nto speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.\nBourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists\nmight possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically\nconcealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the\npresent system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that\nsystem, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\nThe Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.\nThe working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat\nmust first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute\nitself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\nNational differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the\ndevelopment of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to uniformity in the mode of\nproduction and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.\nThe supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading\ncivilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.\nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one\nnation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 11/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nnation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\nThe charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical, and, generally, from an\nideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.\nDoes it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views and conceptions, in one word, man’s\nconsciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations\nand in his social life?\nWhat else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in\nproportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its\nruling class.\nWhen people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express the fact, that within the old\nsociety, the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even\npace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.\nWhen the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When\nChristian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with\nthe then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave\nexpression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.\n“Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral, philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in\nthe course of historical development. But religion, morality philosophy, political science, and law, constantly\nsurvived this change.”\n“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc. that are common to all states of society.\nBut Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting\nthem on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.”\nWhat does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development\nof class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.\nBut whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one\npart of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the\nmultiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot\ncompletely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.\nThe Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that\nits development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\nBut let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\nWe have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class, is to raise the proletariat to\nthe position of ruling as to win the battle of democracy.\nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to\ncentralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling\nclass; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible.\nOf course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of\nproperty, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear\neconomically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,\nnecessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely\nrevolutionising the mode of production.\nThese measures will of course be different in different countries.\nNevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\n1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\n2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\n3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.\n4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\n5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an\nexclusive monopoly.\n6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.\n7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of\nwaste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 12/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\n8. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\n9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between\ntown and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.\n10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present\nform. Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.\nWhen, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been\nconcentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political\ncharacter. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing\nanother. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances,\nto organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps\naway by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the\nconditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its\nown supremacy as a class.\nIn place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association,\nin which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 13/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nIII.\nSOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE\n1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM\nA. Feudal Socialism\nOwing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to\nwrite pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French revolution of July 1830, and in the English\nreform agitation, these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political\ncontest was altogether out of the question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even in the domain\nof literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.\nIn order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to lose sight, apparently, of their own interests,\nand to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone.\nThus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering in his ears\nsinister prophecies of coming catastrophe.\nIn this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of\nthe future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart’s core;\nbut always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history.\nThe aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.\nBut the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted\nwith loud and irreverent laughter.\nOne section of the French Legitimists and “Young England” exhibited this spectacle.\nIn pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget\nthat they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different, and that are now antiquated.\nIn showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern\nbourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.\nFor the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation\nagainst the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed, which is\ndestined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.\nWhat they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat, as that it creates a\nrevolutionary proletariat.\nIn political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary\nlife, despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of\nindustry, and to barter truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.\nAs the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal\nSocialism.\nNothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against\nprivate property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and\npoverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but\nthe holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.\nB. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\nThe feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose\nconditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The mediaeval\nburgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those countries\nwhich are but little developed, industrially and commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side\nwith the rising bourgeoisie.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 14/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nIn countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has\nbeen formed, fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as a supplementary\npart of bourgeois society. The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down\ninto the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment\napproaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be\nreplaced, in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.\nIn countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population, it was natural\nthat writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use, in their criticism of the\nbourgeois regime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these\nintermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.\nSismondi was the head of this school, not only in France but also in England.\nThis school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern\nproduction. It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous\neffects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands;\noverproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of\nthe proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial\nwar of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the\nold nationalities.\nIn its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production\nand of exchange, and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to cramping the modern\nmeans of production and of exchange, within the framework of the old property relations that have been, and\nwere bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.\nIts last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture, patriarchal relations in agriculture.\nUltimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form\nof Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.\nC. German, or “True,” Socialism\nThe Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure of a\nbourgeoisie in power, and that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was introduced into\nGermany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.\nGerman philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits, eagerly seized on this literature, only\nforgetting, that when these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social conditions had not\nimmigrated along with them. In contact with German social conditions, this French literature lost all its\nimmediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of\nthe eighteenth century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the demands of\n“Practical Reason” in general, and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified\nin their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human Will generally.\nThe world of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their\nancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own\nphilosophic point of view.\nThis annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated, namely, by\ntranslation.\nIt is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the\nclassical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed this process with the\nprofane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance,\nbeneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote “Alienation of Humanity,” and\nbeneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote “dethronement of the Category of the\nGeneral,” and so forth.\nThe introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French historical criticisms they dubbed\n“Philosophy of Action,” “True Socialism,” “German Science of Socialism,” “Philosophical Foundation of\nSocialism,” and so on.\nThe French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. And, since it ceased in\nthe hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having\novercome “French one-sidedness” and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of truth;\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 15/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nnot the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no\nclass, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.\nThis German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor\nstock-in-trade in such mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.\nThe fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie, against feudal aristocracy and\nabsolute monarchy, in other words, the liberal movement, became more earnest.\nBy this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to “True” Socialism of confronting the political\nmovement with the Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism, against\nrepresentative government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois\nlegislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain, and\neverything to lose, by this bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the French\ncriticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society, with its\ncorresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very\nthings whose attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.\nTo the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors, country squires and officials, it\nserved as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\nIt was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets with which these same governments, just\nat that time, dosed the German working-class risings.\nWhile this “True” Socialism thus served the governments as a weapon for fighting the German\nbourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the German\nPhilistines. In Germany the petty bourgeois class, a relique of the sixteenth century, and since then constantly\ncropping up again under various forms, is the real social basis of the existing state of things.\nTo preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. The industrial and political\nsupremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction; on the one hand, from the concentration of\ncapital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. “True” Socialism appeared to kill these two\nbirds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.\nThe robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly\nsentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry “eternal truths,” all\nskin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public. And on its part,\nGerman Socialism recognised, more and more, its own calling as the bombastic representative of the pettybourgeois Philistine.\nIt proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to be the typical\nman. To every villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the\nexact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the “brutally\ndestructive” tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class\nstruggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847)\ncirculate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.\n2. CONSERVATIVE, OR BOURGEOIS, SOCIALISM\nA part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances, in order to secure the continued\nexistence of bourgeois society.\nTo this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the\nworking class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals,\ntemperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of Socialism has,\nmoreover, been worked out into complete systems.\nWe may cite Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère as an example of this form.\nThe Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and\ndangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and\ndisintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally\nconceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable\nconception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system,\nand thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat\nshould remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the\nbourgeoisie.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 16/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nA second and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every\nrevolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class, by showing that no mere political reform, but only\na change in the material conditions of existence, in economic relations, could be of any advantage to them.\nBy changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means\nunderstands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be effected only by a\nrevolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms,\ntherefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost,\nand simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of\nspeech.\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class.\nPrison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word\nof bourgeois Socialism.\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois—for the benefit of the working class.\n3. CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM\nWe do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given voice to\nthe demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\nThe first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in times of universal excitement,\nwhen feudal society was being overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped\nstate of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions\nthat had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone. The\nrevolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a\nreactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.\nThe Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others,\nspring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between proletariat\nand bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians).\nThe founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as the action of the decomposing\nelements, in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the\nspectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement.\nSince the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry, the\neconomic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation\nof the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that are to create\nthese conditions.\nHistorical action is to yield to their personal inventive action, historically created conditions of\nemancipation to fantastic ones, and the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation of the proletariat to the\norganisation of society specially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into\nthe propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.\nIn the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class, as\nbeing the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the\nproletariat exist for them.\nThe undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this\nkind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of\nevery member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large,\nwithout distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they\nunderstand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society?\nHence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by\npeaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of\nexample, to pave the way for the new social Gospel.\nSuch fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very\nundeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first instinctive\nyearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 17/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nBut these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack every principle\nof existing society. Hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working\nclass. The practical measures proposed in them—such as the abolition of the distinction between town and\ncountry, of the family, of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage\nsystem, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the functions of the State into a mere\nsuperintendence of production, all these proposals, point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms\nwhich were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in their\nearliest, indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.\nThe significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical\ndevelopment. In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic\nstanding apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all theoretical\njustification. Therefore, although the originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their\ndisciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their\nmasters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour,\nand that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still dream of\nexperimental realisation of their social Utopias, of founding isolated “phalansteres,” of establishing “Home\nColonies,” of setting up a “Little Icaria”—duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem—and to realise all these\ncastles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By degrees they\nsink into the category of the reactionary conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by\nmore systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their\nsocial science.\nThey, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class; such action,\naccording to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\nThe Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the\n“Réformistes.”\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61/pg61-images.html 18/24\n\n12/23/25, 11:00 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nIV.\nPOSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE\nVARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES\nSection II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the\nChartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.\nThe Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary\ninterests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the\nfuture of that movement. In France the Communists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the\nconservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to\nphrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\nIn Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of\nantagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.\nIn Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national\nemancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\nIn Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute\nmonarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition\nof the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may\nstraightaway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the\nbourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the\nreactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois\nrevolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation, and with\na much more developed proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the\neighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an\nimmediately following proletarian revolution.\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social\nand political order of things.\nIn all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no\nmatter what its degree of development at the time.\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be\nattained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a\nCommunistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.\nWORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO ***\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a\nUnited States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to\nreaching Project GutenbergTM’s goals and ensuring that the Project GutenbergTM collection will remain\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nwas created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project GutenbergTM and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and\ndonations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation\norganized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.\nContributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801)\n596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s\nwebsite and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\nProject GutenbergTM depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations\nto carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated\nequipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in\nall 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit\ndonations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\nwww.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation\nrequirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such\nstates who approach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax\ntreatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations\nare accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5.
