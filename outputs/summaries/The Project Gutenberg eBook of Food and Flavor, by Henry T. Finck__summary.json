Finck. The French are far ahead of us in this respect; they are a nation of gastronomers, understanding fully the importance to health and happiness of raising only the best foodstuffs, cooking them in savory ways and eating them with intelligence and pleasure. One of the main objects of the present volume is to show that we have the material for the making of an even more gastronomic nation than the French are, and that Americans, especially if caught young, can be taught to eat in a leisurely way and to refuse to accept anything that lacks appetizing flavor. Flavor! What more we spend on food—and we probably average five times that amount—goes chiefly for flavor. This being so, it seems passing strange that while so many good books have been written on the nutritive aspects of foods, mine is the first volume in any language treating specially of this same flavor, on which we spend so much of our income, and which is so important to our health. It was this misunderstanding that prevented me from keeping the title \"Flavor in Food\" which I had intended to use. At a conference with the publishers we decided that (since, after all, the book also discusses many other aspects of the food question), it would be wiser to use the title \"Food and Flavor.\" Nevertheless, Flavor (with a big \"F\" to emphasize its importance[x)v i]s the principal theme, and the most important chapters are the second and the last in which I discuss its superlative value, not only as the source of countless wholesome pleasures of the table, but as a guide to health. The gist of the book lies in the sections \"An Amazing Blunder\" and \"A New Psychology of Eating,\" in which I have shown that we need flavor as much as we need food if we wish to be well; for food without flavor is not appetizing; and when food is not appetizing it lies in the stomach like lead and causes dyspepsia, the national American plague. In the pages concerned with \"Ungastronomic America\" and \"Our Denatured Foods,\" I have dwelt on some of the evils which have resulted from the giving up of the old-fashioned condiments (especially woodsmoke) in favor of the much cheaper chemical preservatives which denature our food, that is, destroy its appetizing flavor, and give rise to countless adulterations and deceptions. There is need of a good deal of hard fighting, for there are in many towns health officers who thrive on \"graft\" as well as wealthy manufacturers of undesirable preservatives who prevent the passage or enforcement of pure food laws; yet I believe the time is not very far distant when these two chapters will have little more than a historic interest. The Government of the United States has done more than that of any other country to give useful advice to the growers of food products—and to cooks, too! Farming is 6/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. defined as \"cultivating the ground in order to raise food\"; and why farmers, quite as much as epicures, should be interested in the best foods, I have explained in the section headed \"Commercial Value of Flavor,\" w[xivtihi] illustrations showing how a tiller of the soil can double or quintuple his income or even make a big fortune by taking the demand for appetizing flavor as a guide. I have dwelt on the good things raised and prepared in those countries, such as the salads, the poultry, the bread, the butter, the cheeses, the wonderful cuisine of France; the olive oil, the economical substitutes for meat, and the macaroni (the real staff of life) of Italy; the diverse delicatessen of Germany (including live fish brought to the kitchen and genuinely smoked meats and fish); the Wiltshire bacon, the Southdown mutton, the cakes and marmalades of Great Britain. 7/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. [3] FOOD AND FLAVOR I UNGASTRONOMIC AMERICA MARK TWAIN'S PATRIOTIC PALATE ARK TWAIN swore by American food as he did by the American flag. It must be admitted, also, that American cookery has made considerable progress in the last decades, and that there has been an improvement in eating habits since Dickens, in \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" (1843), described the \"violent bell ringing\"; the \"mad rush for the dining-room\"; the \"great heaps of indigestible matter\" which 8/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Our great national food expert and reformer, Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, put the matter in a nutshell when he said in a lecture before the General Federation of Women's Clubs, that \"there is no country in the world where food is so plentiful, and no country in the world where it is so badly cooked, as right here in the United States.\" In a southwestern railway restaurant a miner once said to me he had not eaten such an abominable meal in all the years he had spent in the wilderness. 9/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T.

Thus, in stopping one day for supper in one 10/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Of greater importance was the fact that the Harvey eating-houses served as schools to all the Southwest, bringing about a general reform. The most astonishing thing about this is that the average American enjoys a good meal, if he can ge[t9 ]it, not a bit less than the average European, as I have observed hundreds of times in our own best eating houses and in foreign hotels and restaurants during ten trips to Europe. One of the most precious things they had brought from the old country was the skill to cook a savory meal—a meal that one could enjoy to the full without feeling the pangs of dyspeptic remorse for hours afterwards. 11/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. There are and have been excellent cooks of this nation, but as a rule the Irish are not so interested in this art as the French, Germans, Italians and Swedes, [a1n2]d the results are deplorable, especially when, as is usually the case, the mistress is herself so ignorant that she cannot tell the cook why the food is wrong and how it could be improved. Their indifference to the sources and the quality of the raw material of the food they ate, brought into existence a horde of adulterators and poisoners on a scale never before witnessed anywhere—and that is another important reason why we are not a gastronomic nation. With such sophisticated material the best cooks in the world could not prepare appetizing, wholesome meals; [a1n4]d when meals are not appetizing, men lose interest in them, bolting their food, and passing on to things that seem more important and agreeable. Adulterators and spoilers of food have existed since the days of the ancient Greeks and Romans and probably they flourished long before them; but never before had the far-famed \"Yankee ingenuity\" been brought to bear on the ignoble task of deceiving people as to what they were eating and drinking. Of this ingenuity a striking illustration was given at Washington when the pure food agitators, headed by Dr. Wiley of the Department of Agriculture, gave an exhibit before Congress. 12/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. THE DANGER IN OUR FOOD. That bottle was a sample of thousands of adulterated or entirely spurious \"foods\" for which Ameri[c15a]n men and women had been for a long time spending good money in the belief that they were getting what they paid for. A quarter of a century ago the food poisoners and adulterators spread a net of fraud across the United States, the like of which the world had never seen; and for a long time the American public, with the meekness (up to a certain point!) for which it has become notorious, submitted to this abuse, eating the drugged food and suffering the daily pangs of indigestion, wondering vaguely what was the matter—why Europeans found us a nation of dyspeptics—and paying fortunes to doctors, and to vendors of patent medicines, without being able to avert the final general breakdown. The chemicals used were formalin, boric and salicylic acid, fluo-sylicate of ammonium, aniline dyes, and a number of secret compounds that were sold to packers and dealers, enabling them to doctor spoiled meats and other foods in such a way as to deceive the purchaser and consumer into thinking them fresh and wholesome. \"The use of antiseptics as preservatives is becoming alarmingly great,\" declared Prof. A. S. Mitchell, analytical chemist of the Wisconsin Dairy and Food Commission, before the Senatorial Committee on P[1u7r]e Food Investigation. 13/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. A Philadelphian investigator of adulterated food, H. Wharton Amberling, wrote: \"There has been adulteration for ages. \"It is estimated,\" said the New York \"Evening Post,\" \"that the people of the United States spend no less than five billion dollars a year for food and that nine-tenths of this money is paid for articles of food which are more or less adulterated. The art of adulterating food has been carried to a v[2e1r]y fine point by American ingenuity and has proved immensely profitable to those who practise it, while it has undoubtedly worked great damage to the general health.... 14/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. A matter for the Health Department A report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station called attention to the fact that eighty-nine samples of tea were all found pure as a result of the federal law of 1897, which established a board of seven experts to enforce the statute and forbade importation of the adulterated article. Miss Alice Lakey, chairman of the food investigating committee of the Food Consumers' League, made a collection, as the New York \"Sun\" reported, of squares of flannel, a dozen of them, in brilliant hues of green, 15/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Here are three, which show how [a2n3]y family in the United States might have reasonably taken forty doses of chemical preservatives and coal tar dyes in one day: BREAKFAST Sausages containing coal tar dye and borax Baker's Bread containing alum Butter containing coal tar dye Canned Cherries containing coal tar dye and salicylic acid Pancakes containing alum Syrup containing sodium sulphate DINNER Tomato Soup with coal tar dye and benzoic acid Cabbage and Corned Beef with saltpeter Corn Scallops with sulphurous acid and formaldehyde Canned Peas with salicylic acid Catsup with coal tar dye and benzoic acid Vinegar with coal tar dye Mince Pie with boracic acid Pickles with copperas, sodium sulphate and salicylic acid Lemon Ice Cream with methyl alcohol SUPPER Bread and Butter with alum and coal tar dye Canned Beef with borax Canned Peaches with sodium sulphite, coal tar dye and salicylic acid Pickles with copperas, sodium sulphate and formaldehyde Catsup with coal tar dye and benzoic acid Lemon Cake with alum Baked Pork and Beans with formaldehyde 16/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. One of the earliest battles was fought over borax, and it was in this battle that Dr. Wiley first came before the general public prominently. During the months from December, 1902, to July 1, 1903, he made a series of experiments on twelve young men in Washington as to the influence on the health of food containing boric acid or borax. Some of the conclusions reac[h25e]d were thus summed up briefly: When boric acid or its equivalent in borax is taken in food in quantities not exceeding a half gram daily, no immediate effects are observed; after a time there occur occasional loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the head, gastric discomfort, and general ill-feeling. The results in general indicate that it is not advisable to use borax in articles of food intended for common and continuous use. While in this frame of mind I wrote the following editorial for the New York \"Evening Post\" (April 8, 1903): Dr. Wiley, of the Department of Agriculture, seems to require a long time to decide whether his \"brigade of poison eaters,\" as the Washington wits have dubbed his free boarders, are really eating poison or only harmless food preservatives unjustly suspected of being injurious. Many of us are probably eating more or less of drugged food all the time without actually having to be taken to the hospital; but many others do suffer in health, vitality and capacity for work from eating it. In regard to salicylic acid and formaldehyde, Dr. Wiley himself wrote in \"Leslie's Weekly\" two years ago that there is no doubt of the pernicious influence of these preservatives in some cases. The inevitable inference from such facts is either that the use of boric acid as a preservative of food should be prohibited by law, or, at least, that the law should require mention of its use 17/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Then came Dr. Wiley's verdict, which proclaimed him the honest, bold, incorruptible champion of truth who was soon to become respected, admired, and idolized by the whole American public, with the exception of those who had commercial reasons for disliking him. 18/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. The old-fashioned way 19/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. These remarks are of the utmost importance, for they call attention to the fact that even if the chemical, non-condimental preservatives were not slow poisons, it would be necessary to forbid their use because they enable unscrupulous persons to make foods of the most nauseating substances. Many little children killed from eating ice cream and bakery products never would have tasted them if the smell and taste of the rotten eggs and putrid milk had not been hidden by the chemicals. The great outcry raised by all these startling revelations concerning the unscrupulous methods of the food poisoners resulted in the passage, in 1906, of the epoch-making Food and Drugs Act, which gave the United States a most elaborate and minute set of laws for the protection of the public and the punishment of offenders. The result was an immediate and decided improvement in many departments, especially that of canned fruits, concerning which Dr. Wiley wrote in 1911 that \"the time is now rapidly approaching when all such goods will be free of any imitation or adulteration, and this will add greatly to their value in the mar[k3e2t]s of the country.\" \"If you took all the food in New York City to-day and put it in a big tent down in Texas, I would throw away 40 per cent. \"The people here in New York City are being hourly poisoned by food labeled as absolutely pure. This, sold in bottles, yields a profit of over $20 a 20/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Concerning the cheap candies that are still dearer to the children, Harry P. Cassidy in an address before the wholesale candy dealers (reported in the New York \"Sun\" of March 10, 1912), said: \"We have found burnt umber in candy which is sold and guaranteed as pure to the small shopkeepers. America is specially noted, as Rutledge Rutherford remarks in the \"National Food Magazine\" (1912),[ 3f4o]r two things—its chemicalized food and its infantile mortality. According to the estimate of the New York food expert, Alfred W. McCann, three million persons in the United States were made ill by adulterated foods in 1911. That was five years after the passing of the Pure Food Law. A dishonest man in one State can do all the food \"doping\" he pleases as long as he does not sell any of it in another State. \"If a grocer knew that a can of tomatoes or a can of sardines sold by him could be taken to the corner and analyzed and if found bad that he would be prosecuted, the pure food law would be a real thing,\" says Gaston G. Netter, who asserts that if New York City would bring about such a reform—at a cost of perhaps $150,000 a year—it would \"do away with half the medical clinics.\" Some of the largest American manufacturing firms have followed this policy voluntarily, though the prices they have to pay for good fresh material places them at a great disadvantage to the adulterators who buy any rotten old thing and \"renovate\" it, or else make the article entirely of chemicals. asks Mr. McCann; and his answer tells the plain truth: \"Each State has some powerful pet food industry to protect and some weak legislators willing to do the bidding of the fakers.\" 21/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Dr. Wiley, seeing that his efforts to secure the enforcement of the Pure Food Laws were useless, at last resigned, and in \"Good Housekeepi[n37g]\" for October, 1912, he gave some of the reasons for this step. For instance, an exhaustive report of the experiments made in the Bureau of Chemistry, which showed, in Dr. Wiley's opinion, \"the injuriousness of copper sulphate when added to foods, has been hibernating in the Department of Archives for the past four years and its use permitted in the interim.\" The opposition to Dr. Wiley's decisions brought about \"practical paralysis in all matters pertaining to the addition of benzoic acid, sulphurous acid, saccharine, sulphate of copper, and alum to food products. How bitterly the war against Dr. Wiley and pure-food legislation was carried on, not only at Washington but in various States with aid from Washington, is illustrated by the following extract from a letter written to Dr. Wiley by the Health Commissioner of Indiana: It is not necessary to recall to you the tremendous difficulties under which the State labored when it endeavored to prevent the overthrow of its pure food law because of the activities of the Department of Agriculture in behalf of the firms who were seeking that end; how we were refused the assistance of yourself and your chemists; how we had to compel the getting of testimony by an order of the court of the District of Columbia, and how, on the other hand, employees of the Government known to be in sympathy with the firms bringing suit against us were sent to Indianapolis to testify against the State at the expense of the Department of Agriculture. Another illustration of the war on the Pure Food Laws was given in the New York \"Globe\" of Oct. 24, 1912, by Alfred W. McCann. After pointing out that \"there has been no let-up in attempts to deceive,\" and that \"food ideals depend absolutely on the integrity and zeal of a few so-called fanatics like Dr. Wiley, who are thus far responsible for all the advance we have made,\" he goes on to say: [39] In the State of Pennsylvania one of the most active pure food workers, who has contributed energy and zeal to the cause of the people, H. P. Cassidy, special agent of the Pennsylvania Dairy and Food Department, after ten years of remarkable service has been removed from office by the same kind of pressure which finally disposed of Dr. Wiley. If the pure food movement were making the kind of progress which it is thought to be making, such backward steps would not be tolerated by the people, for the dismissal from office of such a man as Cassidy will serve as a warning to other pure food officials not to be too zealous in the discharge of their duties. 22/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Dr. Wiley did not exaggerate when in summing up the situation he printed the following, in italics: No further blot upon the administration of law can, in my opinion, be found in the history of the United States than this effort of the United States Government to paralyze, belittle, and destroy a law passed in the interests of the people of the country. 23/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. We have seen that the non-condimental chemical preservatives used by the food poisoners are highly objectionable on two grounds: (1) because they are usually injurious and often deadly; and (2) because they enable unscrupulous persons to use the filthiest, rottenest material and so doctor it as to deceive the consumer into believing it to be wholesome food, whereas it may, and often does, result in ptomaine poisoning. The chemicals they use, not only make the food they manipulate dangerous to eat, but they also diminish and often completely des[t4r1o]y its Flavor. This destruction of the food Flavors may seem to those who have given no special attention to this matter a thing to be regretted, indeed, but not an actual crime. Too long we have been allowing covetous manufacturers and dealers and incompetent or indolent cooks to spoil our naturally good food. We have done this because we have not as a nation understood that there is nothing in the world on which our health and hourly comfort, our happiness and our capacity for hard work, 24/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. depend so much as on the Flavor of food—those savory qualities which make it appetizing and enjoyable [a4n2]d therefore digestible and helpful. It is not too much to say that the most important problem now before the American public is to learn to enjoy the pleasures of the table and to insist on having savory food at every meal. America's leading educator, Ex-President Eliot of Harvard, has expressed the more rational view of [4o3u]r time in these words: \"Sensuous pleasures, like eating and drinking, are sometimes described as animal, and therefore unworthy, but men are animals and have a right to enjoy without reproach those pleasures of animal existence which maintain health, strength, and life itself.\" There is an old German proverb to the effect that if food is properly chewed it is half digested: Gut gekaut ist halb verdaut. This is literally true, but in England and America, although physicians and others have long known it to be so, it was not impressed on the general public's attention until the newspapers began to comment—some seriously, others facetiously—on the statement that Gladstone, in 1848, adopted certain rules for chewing food to which he ever after adhered and to which some observers attributed his remarkable physical vi[g4o4]r. \"Previous to that,\" said the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" \"he had always paid great attention to the requirements of nature, but at that date he laid down as a rule for his children that thirty-two bites should be given to each mouthful of meat and a somewhat lesser number to bread, fish, etc.\" The main thing was that his \"home rule\" called the attention of two nations to the unwisdom of bolting food and the advantage to health resulting from keeping it for some time in the mouth. 25/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. Mr. Fletcher did not discover the fact that the mouth is also a most important organ of digestion, with the aid of saliva; but he emphasized this important fact in his writings as no other writer had ever done, proclaiming it from the housetops till thousands began to listen and heed and learn and benefit by his preaching; and therein lies the importance of his name in the history of dietetic reform. The gist of his doctrine may be given in a few words: keep all food (soft as well as hard, liquid as well as solid, moist as well as dry) in the mouth and chew it till it has become thoroughly mingled with the saliva, has lost all its flavor, and is ready to disappear down the throat without an effort at swallowing. 26/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. It cannot be denied that medical and other scientific writers were culpable in not enlightening the pu[b4l8i]c on these important matters, and it serves them right, therefore, if Fletcher has got the credit and the fame for 27/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. In particular, I wish to call further attention to his valuable remarks on the necessity of doing more \"mouth work\" than most of us do, and on the importance of agreeable Flavor in food as an aid to digestion. Dr. Campbell, whose admirable articles on The Importance of Mastication cannot be too urgently brought to the reader's attention,[2] has pointed out a very important reason why at present, more than at any other time in the history of man, there is need of mouth digestion. The food of to-day is for the most part soft and pappy, of a kind which does not compel thorough mastication; so much so that Dr. Campbell thinks we may speak of this as \"the age of pap.\" Morbid craving for food not needed is another. Dr. Campbell also agrees with Sir Frederick Treves that the neglect of the mastication of food is a potent cause of appendicitis. 28/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. If you bolt your food, he says, you get \"none of the exquisite taste that Nature's way offers as an allurement for obeying her beneficent demands. It is the way of animals; and Fletcher named his book \"The New Glutton or Epicure\" to call attention to the two ways of taking food. Everybody knows that the fragrance of good food \"makes the mouth water.\" 29/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. He demonstrated in his St. Petersburg laboratory that the mere presence of food in a dog's stomach— which is like a man's in that respect—does not suffice to cause a flow of gastric juice, but that the psychic factor we call appetite—a keen desire for food—causes an abundant flow of that fluid, without which the digestion cannot proceed. Now it might be said that there was really no need of laboratory experiments to tell us that food eaten without enjoyment lies like lead in the stomach and does more harm than good. Instinct showed that way long ago; it did its best to intimate that food should be eaten with interest and enjoyment. 30/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. How often do the people who have charge of the commissariat pay atten[t5io6]n solely to the nutritive value of the food, or place a higher value on everything else than taste!\" Yet it is the \"taste\" (Flavor) of food that arouses the appetite. In more recent text books less attention is paid to appetite as a symptom; but Prof. Pawlow's experiments have again, and for all time, demonstrated its importance. \"Appetite juice\" is one of the suggestive names Professor Pawlow gives to the fluid which digests food in the stomach. There is little or none of it for the man who eats without noticing his food, unable to distract his thoughts from his work, as so often happens to those who live in the midst of the incessant turmoil of large cities. This inattention to the act of eating (to the Flavor of the food) prepares the way for digestive disturbances with all the various diseases following them. Thus, the studies of Dr. Pawlow fully bear out my contention as to the Vital Importance of Flavo[r5 7i]n Food. An American quick-lunch 31/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. 32/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. The French physiologist Longet and the German anatomist Henle were, so far as I could find, the only experts who had an inkling of the gastronomic importance of the sense of smell; but they did not go so far as to formulate the theory I have just expressed in italics. My experiments showed me that not only is it impossible, with the nose clasped (or closed by a cold), to tell the difference between various kinds of meats, or cheeses, or cakes, or vegetables, but also—which no one had ever pointed out—that even in the cas[e6 2o]f sweet and sour substances which do gratify the palate, the sense of smell is much more important than the sense of taste. It is considered a breach of etiquette to smell of things at the table in the ordinary way, because it implies a doubt as to the freshness of the food. But when we eat in the right way we unconsciously guide the air impregnated with the Flavors of the food we are munching, into that region, and that is the way we enjoy our food. It not only provides us with additional table pleasures, the hygienic and tonic value of which has been sufficiently dwelt upon, but it is a fact of unspeakable importance that the more we educate the nose, the more discriminating we make it, and the more stubbornly therefore we insist on having wholesome food only. This new psychology of eating I set forth for the first time in the \"Contemporary Review\" (London, November, 1888), under the title of \"The Gastronomic Value of Odors.\" At that time there was not the same general interest that there is now in the food question. Since his day many things have happened to give the food question an aspect of superlative importance, particularly the wholesale adulterations described in the preceding pages. That article anticipates some important details of his doctrines, but he evidently never saw it, because in his books he makes only one brief reference to the sense of smell and perpetuates all the old errors regarding that insolent pretender, the sense of taste. 33/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. 34/245 The Project Gutenberg eBook of Food and Flavor, by Henry T. Finck. [65] III OUR DENATURED FOODS EARING in mind the superlative importance to our well-being of Flavor in the food we eat, the reader is now in a position to appreciate the full force of a third indictment to be brought against those who spoil our food. The culprits now to be arraigned are those who, from ignorance, indolence, or greed to get rich quick, adopt devices which spoil the Flavor of our food and thus destroy our appetite and undermine the health of the community. The same holds true of smoked fish, which used to make an epicure's mouth water. Why it does so no longer is shown by the following paragraphs from Philadelphia, printed in the New York \"Evening Post\": Fish Was Dyed, not Smoked The dairy and food bureau of the State Agricultural Department has discovered that a large number of delicatessen and other stores of this city have been for a long time selling \"dyed\" fish as a substitute for smoked fish.",

        "This is literally true, but in England and America, although physicians and others have long known it to be so, it was not impressed on the general public's attention until the newspapers began to comment—some seriously, others facetiously—on the statement that Gladstone, in 1848, adopted certain rules for chewing food to which he ever after adhered and to which some observers attributed his remarkable physical vi[g4o4]r. \"Previous to that,\" said the \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" \"he had always paid great attention to the requirements of nature, but at that date he laid down as a rule for his children that thirty-two bites should be given to each mouthful of meat and a somewhat lesser number to bread, fish, etc.\"",
        "After pointing out that \"there has been no let-up in attempts to deceive,\" and that \"food ideals depend absolutely on the integrity and zeal of a few so-called fanatics like Dr. Wiley, who are thus far responsible for all the advance we have made,\" he goes on to say: [39] In the State of Pennsylvania one of the most active pure food workers, who has contributed energy and zeal to the cause of the people, H. P. Cassidy, special agent of the Pennsylvania Dairy and Food Department, after ten years of remarkable service has been removed from office by the same kind of pressure which finally disposed of Dr. Wiley.",
        "I have dwelt on the good things raised and prepared in those countries, such as the salads, the poultry, the bread, the butter, the cheeses, the wonderful cuisine of France; the olive oil, the economical substitutes for meat, and the macaroni (the real staff of life) of Italy; the diverse delicatessen of Germany (including live fish brought to the kitchen and genuinely smoked meats and fish); the Wiltshire bacon, the Southdown mutton, the cakes and marmalades of Great Britain.",
        "\"If a grocer knew that a can of tomatoes or a can of sardines sold by him could be taken to the corner and analyzed and if found bad that he would be prosecuted, the pure food law would be a real thing,\" says Gaston G. Netter, who asserts that if New York City would bring about such a reform—at a cost of perhaps $150,000 a year—it would \"do away with half the medical clinics.\"",
        "Mr. Fletcher did not discover the fact that the mouth is also a most important organ of digestion, with the aid of saliva; but he emphasized this important fact in his writings as no other writer had ever done, proclaiming it from the housetops till thousands began to listen and heed and learn and benefit by his preaching; and therein lies the importance of his name in the history of dietetic reform.",
        "My experiments showed me that not only is it impossible, with the nose clasped (or closed by a cold), to tell the difference between various kinds of meats, or cheeses, or cakes, or vegetables, but also—which no one had ever pointed out—that even in the cas[e6 2o]f sweet and sour substances which do gratify the palate, the sense of smell is much more important than the sense of taste.",
        "defined as \"cultivating the ground in order to raise food\"; and why farmers, quite as much as epicures, should be interested in the best foods, I have explained in the section headed \"Commercial Value of Flavor,\" w[xivtihi] illustrations showing how a tiller of the soil can double or quintuple his income or even make a big fortune by taking the demand for appetizing flavor as a guide."
